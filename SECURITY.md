## Reporting Security Issues
We take security bugs in Meta seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please responsibly disclose by contacting us at security@chanzuckerberg.com.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
